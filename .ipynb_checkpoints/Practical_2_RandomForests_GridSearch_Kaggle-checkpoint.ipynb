    "Ensemble learning is the technique of building multiple models, and then combining them in a manner that is likely to produce better results than individual models.  These models don't have to be classifiers, and can be trained to deal with most tasks. A Random Forest uses one type of ensemble method called bagging to learn multiple decision trees. This forest of Decision Trees is then used to predict the output value by avaraging or voting. As to esnure diversity among various trees, each Decision Tree is constructed using a boostrap sample of the training data, and only a random subset of variables is used at each node. "
